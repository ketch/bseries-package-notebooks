#  Störmer-Verlet method as additive Runge-Kutta method applied to Kepler's problem

The code in this directory reproduces the computations of the modifying
integrator approach for the Störmer-Verlet method applied to Kepler's problem.
To get the modifying integrator equation, execute
```bash
julia kepler.jl
```

The source code was developed with Julia v1.7.2.
